      "\n",
      "The Company is in it's infancy, white boards and work flow charts along with extensive internal market research and my own experience. I am seeking specifically a partner who will compliment my shortcomings in the tech side of this venture. I have the vision, the drive, and the finances to fund the launch. The company is a software/HR/supplemental hiring company that will be web based to be used by companies such as Indeed, Careerbuilder and the U.S. government for candidates seeking employment/job surfing. It is designed to bridge a missing link within the hiring process for the private sector. The reason this gap exists is because of the lack the lack of skilled employees in today's market place among virtually all industries. The secondary function relates specifically to unemployment for the government. This platform is designed to save business' and the tax payers both time and huge sums of money. Preliminary numbers from within my industry assume 10-18k per year per company. Larger scale companies such as law and finance stand to save in excess of 30k annually as a result. Billable's for this company are to be generated first by ad traffic, and by annual subscription. With nearly 28 MILLION registered business' in the US, the market for this is very real, and the demand high. I personally struggle with what this problem would solve daily, and a lot of my colleagues agree we have a real problem.  Add to that the nearly 6 MILLION people (which by the way is VERY LOW historically) on unemployment and the vision suddenly transcends my wildest dreams for opportunity.  I'd be willing to explore other avenues of revenue generation outside of the ones I am currently aware of.\n",

      "I have designed a clinical study testing a drug in a new indication and the database and patient diary needs to be created/stored in a program which is common at many academic medical centers called REDCAP.  It is a fairly intuitive program, anyone who has created an html page can become familiar with, and I have several query instruments that need to be created in the program and it needs to be set up with daily prompts for patients in the study, which is a functionality already built in to the REDCAP database and program.  I would also if possible like to build the pathways - capabilities for data analysis after the study data is entered into the REDCAP database, which I have been told is also quite easy to export the data but I would like to set up this functionality so that several pre-planned analyses can be performed.  If you are familiar with clinical trials, I will need to develop a statistical analysis plan for the data in advance of starting the study, with the pre-specified analysis (primary and secondary) delineated.  I would like to set up the external database if possible to perform these analyses.     \n",
